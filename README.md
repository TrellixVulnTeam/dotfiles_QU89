# System Installation and Configuration

To install run, `install.sh`

Adds `usr`, `opt`, and `bin` to $HOME:
* `bin` is for binaries, usually soft links
* `opt` is for command line and system type files and applications
* `usr` is for user applications intended to be accessed directly

All config files are places in `.config`.

## Install Python
